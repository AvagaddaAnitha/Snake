- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required packages using pip:
  ```
  pip install turtle
  ```

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   python snake_game.py
   ```

### Controls:
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.

### Game Over:
- The game ends when:
